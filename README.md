# Rafael Hiray

I started studying Machine Learning in 2021 and since then I have been constantly evolving to become a Data Scientist. I have a degree in Business Administration and Actuarial Science and I am currently an actuary with experience in the area of supplementary health at Functional Heath.

I am learning the domains of all stages of developing a business solution using Data Science concepts and tools, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I learned a lot and Iâ€™m still learning with every project that I collaborate and every people that I know.

# Data Science Projects:

## [Sales forecast for Rossmann stores](https://github.com/RafaHiray/Rossmann_Sales_Prediction)
A Data Science project where five machine learning models were created to forecast sales for the next six weeks at Rossmann stores and the forecasts can be accessed by users through a bot from the smartphone app Telegram.
